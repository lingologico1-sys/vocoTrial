"""
Tests for the phone mapping, asserted at the level that actually matters: the pose.

The table is read out of ../src/live/polly.ts rather than copied, which is the whole
reason the backend now lives inside vocoTrial. This file used to carry a hand-written
mirror and warn about it: "The mirror is a duplicate, and duplicates drift." It no longer
carries one, so the warning is gone and the drift is impossible -- delete an identifier
from POLLY_VISEMES and test_every_mapped_phone_reaches_a_real_pose fails here, in Python,
naming it. See polly.py.

Assertions are written on the drawn pose rather than the identifier it travels through.
A wrong identifier that still lands on the right pose is invisible to a viewer; a
right-looking identifier that lands on the wrong pose is the bug worth catching.
