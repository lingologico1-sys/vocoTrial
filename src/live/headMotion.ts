/**
 * How the head carries the performance, separated from the face that draws it.
 *
 * Its own module for the same reason visemes.ts is: the face renders this, the
 * live page offers it as a control and the kit page offers it as a switch, so a
 * union three files agree on has no business living inside a component. (React
 * fast refresh also declines to reload a file that exports both a component and
 * constants, which is the cheap version of the same argument.)
 *
 * Every number here is in head units — the 200x200 space Face.tsx draws in — and
 * degrees.

/**
 * The two ways the head moves, and why there are two rather than one settled answer.
 *
 * What both have in common is the part that is no longer negotiable: they move
 * the *whole picture*. Scoping the movement to a head-shaped rectangle was tried
 * at length and abandoned, and the reason is worth keeping written down, because
 * it looks like a solvable problem right up until you measure it. A crop that
 * lifts opens a gap at its bottom edge, and the only pixels available to fill
 * that gap are another copy of the same neck a few units away. Cross-fading the
 * two doubles every edge inside the blend — a collar most of all — into a band
 * across the throat, and the head reads as severed. Feathering harder widens the
 * band. Moving the cut lower puts it in the collar; moving it higher puts it on
 * the jaw, which is worse. There is nowhere on a body to hide that cut.
 *
 * What is left to choose is the *character* of the movement, and these two are
 * genuinely different rather than two tunings of one number:
 *
 *  - `swing` rotates and does not translate. The pivot sits low in the frame, so
 *    the foot of the picture stays where it is and the head arcs over it — which
 *    is, near enough, what a neck does.
 *  - `rise` translates and barely rotates. This is what the face did originally.
 *    Its failing is that a frame sliding bodily upward is what a *camera* does,
 *    not a person; it is kept because that is a matter of taste and the only
 *    honest way to settle it is to flip between them on the same sentence.

/**
 * How much larger than the frame the artwork is drawn, as a multiplier.
 *
 * The cost of rotating a square picture: turn it about any point on its lower
 * half and one bottom corner swings upward out of frame, uncovering a wedge of
 * whatever is behind. Six units of it at full volume, against the dark panel the
 * preview sits in — small, and the sort of small the eye finds immediately,
 * because it is a hard-edged triangle appearing in a corner on the beat.
 *
 * So the picture is drawn a tenth larger than it needs to be and the frame crops
 * the difference, which is what overscan has always been for.
 *
 * Ten percent is sized to the numbers above and the headroom is thinner than it
 * looks, so here is the measurement rather than a reassurance: at the shipping
 * 2.5° the nearest frame corner clears the artwork by 2.2 units, at 3° by 0.7,
 * and somewhere around 3.2° it stops clearing at all — after which the top-left
 * corner of the frame is uncovered and a wedge of panel shows through on every
 * stressed syllable. Raising the swing angle means raising this too. The pair
 * are one setting wearing two names, and only one of them fails loudly.
 *
 * Applied to the group rather than to the base image, so the mouth patches, the
 * lids and the brow crops scale with the picture they are registered to. Scaling
 * only the base would slide every patch off the face it belongs to.
